# Lead Generation & Follow-Up Automation Zap

This Zap automates the process of capturing leads from Google Forms, storing them in a CRM or Google Sheets, sending an automatic follow-up email, and creating a task for manual follow-up.

### Overview:
- **Trigger:** New lead submitted through Google Forms.
- **Actions:**
  1. Store lead data in **Google Sheets** or **CRM**.
  2. Send an automated **Follow-Up Email** using **Gmail** or **Mailchimp**.
  3. Create a **Follow-Up Task** in **Google Tasks**, **Trello**, or **Asana**.

### Technologies Used:
- **Zapier**: for connecting the apps and creating automation.
- **Google Forms**: for lead capture.
- **Google Sheets/CRM (HubSpot, Pipedrive)**: for storing lead information.
- **Gmail** or **Mailchimp**: for email follow-ups.

3. An automatic email follow-up is sent to the lead using **Gmail** or **Mailchimp**.
4. A task is created in **Google Tasks**, allowing you to track and manually follow up with the lead.
